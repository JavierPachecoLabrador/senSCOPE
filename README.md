# senSCOPE
This repository containts the code of the senSCOPE model (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2020, discussion) as well as the code for the multiple-constraint inversion approach method (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2019) adapted for the inversion senSCOPE: senSCOPE_MCinv.

senSCOPE (Pacheco-Labrador et al., under review) is a modified version of the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE, Van der Tol at al. 2009) model, and mainly developped over the SCOPE code version 1.73. Therefore, the present version is coordinated with the original code for consistency. senSCOPE adapts radiative transfer and plant function processes to represent canopies featuring mixed green and senescent leaves.

For general information about the functioning of SCOPE, check:
  Manual is available at ReadTheDocs https://scope-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

Information about senSCOPE can be found in the Documentation_senSCOPE_1.73.pdf included with the code

Information aobut senSCOPE_MCinv can be found in the Documentation_senSCOPE_MCinv-1.02 included with the code
